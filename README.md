# roleschedule_app

The Roleschedule application is my first laravel application developed by me(Abeiku Yorke). This application was developed for KNUST UITS deaprtment, to enable users record participants for a particular event that is going on in the school. Eg. We can record the participants of a Biometric event and to which location the particular event took place.

There are two users for this application:
1. Normal Users
2. Super Users

**Normal Users**
i. The user can add a participant to the participant's list.
ii. The user can add an event and view all events and participants.
iii. The user can add a roleschedule, when a roleschedule is added, an email is sent to the participant that was selected for that event.

**Super Users**
i. The super user can add a normal user, when a user is created an email is sent to their email, the email contains their credentials to log into the system.
ii. The Super user can do all of what the normal user can do.
iii. The super user can see the user that created the particular role schedule.
